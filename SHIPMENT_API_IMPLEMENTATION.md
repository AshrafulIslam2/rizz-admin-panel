- `CreateDeliveryAreaDto` - For creating new areas (name, charge, isActive?)
- `UpdateDeliveryAreaDto` - For updating areas (name?, charge?, isActive?)

**API Methods:**

- `getAllDeliveryAreas()` - GET /shipment/delivery-areas
- `getActiveDeliveryAreas()` - GET /shipment/delivery-areas/active
- `getDeliveryAreaById(id)` - GET /shipment/delivery-areas/:id
- `createDeliveryArea(payload)` - POST /shipment/delivery-areas
- `updateDeliveryArea(id, payload)` - PUT /shipment/delivery-areas/:id
- `deleteDeliveryArea(id)` - DELETE /shipment/delivery-areas/:id
- `toggleDeliveryAreaStatus(id)` - PATCH /shipment/delivery-areas/:id/toggle

```

## How It Works

### 1. **On Page Load:**

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  fetchDeliveryAreas(); // Calls GET /shipment/delivery-areas
}, []);
```

### 2. **Create New Area:**

- User clicks "Add Delivery Area"
- Fills in name and charge in dialog
- Clicks "Add Area" → Calls POST /shipment/delivery-areas
- New area appears in table

### 3. **Edit Area:**

- User clicks Edit button (pencil icon)
- Fields become editable
- User modifies values
- Clicks Save → Calls PUT /shipment/delivery-areas/:id
- Table updates with new values

### 4. **Toggle Status:**

- User clicks Power button
- Calls PATCH /shipment/delivery-areas/:id/toggle
- Badge updates (Active ↔ Inactive)
- Button icon remains visible

### 5. **Delete Area:**

- User clicks Delete button (trash icon)
- Confirms in browser dialog
- Calls DELETE /shipment/delivery-areas/:id
- Row removed from table
